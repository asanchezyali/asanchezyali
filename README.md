Hi! I'm a mathematician with experience in software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. I have a pretty stacked toolbox of skills with Python, JavaScript, Rust, C++, C, and more. With my critical, curious, and creative mindset, I am constantly on the lookout for new ideas and ways to improve my work.

If you're interested in connecting with me, feel free to send me an email or follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asanchezyali/). I look forward to exchanging impressions.
